## Key Features of SketchUp Pro for Mac

### Intuitive 3D Modeling Workflow
SketchUp’s core strength remains its simple yet powerful modeling system. The **push–pull tool** allows users to quickly convert 2D shapes into complex 3D geometry. Drawing tools such as lines, arcs, rectangles, and freehand curves enable fast conceptual modeling without technical barriers.

Inference snapping and axis locking ensure precision, making SketchUp suitable for architectural layouts, furniture design, landscaping, and mechanical visualization.

### Native macOS and Apple Silicon Optimization
SketchUp Pro for Mac 2026 is officially optimized for **macOS Ventura and newer versions**. Native Apple Silicon support continues to improve, providing better GPU acceleration, faster viewport rendering, and smoother navigation on **M1, M2, and newer chips**.

Although Intel Macs are still supported, Apple Silicon systems deliver noticeably better performance in large models and complex scenes.

### Layout for Construction Documentation
SketchUp Pro includes **Layout**, a professional tool for creating 2D documentation from 3D models. Users can generate scaled floor plans, elevations, sections, and construction drawings directly linked to SketchUp files.

Any changes made to the 3D model automatically update in Layout, reducing revision errors and saving time during project development.

### Extension Warehouse Ecosystem
The **Extension Warehouse** offers thousands of plugins that expand SketchUp’s functionality. Popular extensions include:

- Rendering engines  
- Parametric design tools  
- Terrain modeling utilities  
- Energy analysis plugins  
- BIM-related add-ons  

SketchUp Pro for Mac 2026 improves compatibility with updated extensions, ensuring smoother workflows for professional users.

### 3D Warehouse Access
The built-in **3D Warehouse** provides millions of ready-made models, including furniture, architectural elements, vehicles, lighting fixtures, and vegetation. This feature significantly reduces modeling time and helps maintain design consistency.

Users can also upload and share their own models, supporting collaborative workflows.

### Broad File Format Support
SketchUp Pro supports a wide range of import and export formats, including:

- DWG / DXF  
- IFC  
- OBJ  
- FBX  
- 3DS  
- COLLADA  

This flexibility ensures seamless integration with CAD, BIM, and rendering software used in professional pipelines.

## What’s New in SketchUp Pro for Mac 2026

The 2026 release focuses heavily on **realism**, **interoperability**, and **performance**.

### HDRI Environments (New)
SketchUp 2026 introduces **Environments**, allowing users to apply HDRI lighting setups directly inside SketchUp. This feature improves scene realism by providing accurate ambient lighting and reflections without relying entirely on external render engines.

### Photorealistic Materials
New photoreal material workflows enable better texture depth, surface realism, and lighting interaction. Materials now respond more naturally to environment lighting, enhancing presentation quality directly within the modeling viewport.

### Improved IFC Export and BIM Support
IFC export has been significantly improved in SketchUp Pro 2026, making it more reliable for BIM workflows. Architects and engineers can now exchange data more accurately with other BIM platforms while maintaining object hierarchy and metadata.

### Live Components Enhancements
Live Components receive major usability upgrades, including better scaling, rotation controls, and parameter editing. These dynamic objects allow users to adjust dimensions and properties in real time without rebuilding geometry.

### Performance and Stability Improvements
SketchUp 2026 delivers noticeable performance gains, particularly on Apple Silicon Macs. Viewport responsiveness, scene switching, and shadow calculations are faster, while crash frequency has been reduced compared to earlier releases.

### Scene and Workflow Refinements
Scene management has been refined, making it easier to organize views for presentations and documentation. These updates improve productivity for users handling large, multi-scene projects.
